# an understanding of design (including hierarchy of aggregate objects and an inheritance tree),

Not sure if I am supposed to draw something but I'll just include an image. The Pizza class holds all of the arguments such as meat, sauce, dough, and veggie. The Pepperoni class, Canadian_Bacon, and Chicken_Artichoke all inherit from it and are used as presets for the user.

# an understanding of testing (test your methods and attributes, maybe have a whole automated example!),

Only used simple print statements to check if the save ingredients and load ingredients functions were working properly. Other than that, unsure of what other methods I could use, wasn't able to get feedback from you so that I could learn, since this is my weakest area in this class.

# user IO, file IO, and input validation,

The input output and input validation is seen when adding ingredients as well as if you dont input anything in. Also if you try to delete nothing or load nothing.
# recursion,

Didn't have any in this project, wasn't sure what I could do with this project. I tried reaching out to you prior to this project to get direction on any project idea but I didn't hear back from you so I just put this together.
